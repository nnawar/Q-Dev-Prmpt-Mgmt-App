# Chat App with Prompt Management
Aside from using jupyter notebooks for ML or Quantum computing, I have no experience writing code.
This app here was built from scratch using the coding assistant: [Amazon Q Developer](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/).

When I say "from scratch", I loterally mean I started by asking Amazon-Q a similar prompt to this one here:

>*Guide me through what I need to provide you in order to build a streamlit application that allows users to send their prompts against a choice of amazon bedrock foundational models. The user should be able to type their prompt from scratch, or start from a list of curated administrator prompts*
